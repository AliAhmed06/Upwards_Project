The value of the deal has not been disclosed. The DMCC-based Emirates Gold is into refining and minting of coins and bars. Its operations also cover smelting and assaying (which is to do with determining the quality of gold).\n\n Just as important, Emirates Gold has been reinstated in the UAEs Good Delivery List, which will be decisive in the companys future expansion plans and access to international markets as a supplier of gold. It was in mid 2023 that the refiner was omitted from the List.\n\n A new CEO, Abhijit Shah, has also taken over the mantle at the refiner. “With the support of Bright East Holding 1 and our restored position on the UAEs Good Delivery List, we are positioned to lead the market through innovation and excellence,” said Shah. “This transformation will allow us to set new standards and expand our offerings, delivering unparalleled value to our clients worldwide.”",

This liquid acts as a heat transfer medium, directly removing heat generated by the components.",
  "ImmersiveCoolingSystemSubHeading2": "Single-phase: liquid stays liquid",
  "ImmersiveCoolingSystemSubHeading2Description": "In single-phase immersion cooling, the dielectric fluid remains in its liquid state throughout the cooling process.

This approach is generally simpler and less complex than two-phase methods.",
  "ImmersiveCoolingSystemSubHeading3": "Two-phase: coolant boils to remove heat",
  "ImmersiveCoolingSystemSubHeading3Description": "Two-phase immersion cooling utilizes a dielectric fluid that undergoes a phase change—from liquid to vapor— during the cooling process. As the components generate heat, the liquid coolant boils, absorbing significant amounts of heat through the vaporization process. This latent heat of vaporization makes two-phase cooling particularly efficient. The vapor is then condensed and recycled back into the liquid phase.",

Both coolants are rigorously tested to ensure compatibility and prevent corrosion",
  "ImmersiveCoolingSystemHeading2SubHeading2": "High-Efficiency Heat Exchanger",
  "ImmersiveCoolingSystemHeading2SubHeading2Description": "Our system incorporates a high-performance plate heat exchanger. The design is crucial for efficient heat dissipation, maintaining optimal operating temperatures. We achieve this via precise coolant flow management with an inlet temperature of 32°C and a controlled 7°C rise across the exchanger. This ensures the dielectric fluid remains well within its operational parameters, maximizing cooling efficiency.",
  "ImmersiveCoolingSystemHeading2SubHeading3": "Precision Pump System",
  "ImmersiveCoolingSystemHeading2SubHeading3Description": "Consistent coolant flow is maintained through a robust pump system designed for continuous operation. We monitor flow rates and pressures in real time, adjusting as needed to optimize heat transfer and prevent hotspots.
