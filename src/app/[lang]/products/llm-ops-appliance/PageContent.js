              LLMOps, Upwards&apos;s enterprise-level platform, manages the full
              lifecycle of large language models. It enables enterprises to
              implement these models into production and business processes in
              an agile, efficient, and closed-loop manner. The platform
              optimizes the entire workflow, including: corpus access and
              development, prompt engineering, model training, knowledge
              extraction and fusion, model management, application and agent
              development, operation and maintenance, monitoring and continuous
              improvement of business outcomes.
              <br />
              <br />
              LLMOps supports the latest large language models such as
              Phi-4-14B, Gemma-3-27B, Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-671B,
              text-to-image models like Stable-Diffusion-3.5-Large, embedding
              models like Jina-Embeddings-v3, reranker models like
              Jina-Reranker-v2-Base-Multilingual, and more from Hugging Face. It
              leverages GenAI&apos;s strengths in natural language processing,
              efficient training and inference, and high-precision AI reasoning.
