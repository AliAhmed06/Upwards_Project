    description: `Dubai: One of the UAEs biggest gold refiners, Emirates Gold, has been bought by Bright East Holding 1, which is an ADGM (Abu Dhabi Global Market) licensed entity that operates in the venture capital and private equity space.\n\n
Bright East's takeover of Emirates Gold adds to its reach in the metals and commodities space. The value of the deal has not been disclosed. The DMCC-based Emirates Gold is into refining and minting of coins and bars. Its operations also cover smelting and assaying (which is to do with determining the quality of gold).\n\n
Just as important, Emirates Gold has been reinstated in the UAEs Good Delivery List, which will be decisive in the companys future expansion plans and access to international markets as a supplier of gold. It was in mid 2023 that the refiner was omitted from the List.\n\n
A new CEO, Abhijit Shah, has also taken over the mantle at the refiner. “With the support of Bright East Holding 1 and our restored position on the UAEs Good Delivery List, we are positioned to lead the market through innovation and excellence,” said Shah. “This transformation will allow us to set new standards and expand our offerings, delivering unparalleled value to our clients worldwide.”`,
